### How to Use Byte Eagle

#### 1. Installation Steps

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BitTheByte/Eagle.git
cd Eagle
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 2. Basic Scan

Scan domains listed in a file (`domains.txt`):

```bash
python3 main.py -f domains.txt
```

#### 3. Ping Mode (Check if Hosts are Live)

```bash
python3 main.py -f domains.txt --ping
```

#### 4. Advanced Scan with Multiple Threads and Output to JSON

```bash
python3 main.py -f domains.txt -w 10 --db output.db.json
```

* `-w 10`: Use 10 threads
* `--db output.db.json`: Save scan result in JSON format

#### 5. Debug Mode (Verbose Output)

```bash
python3 main.py -f domains.txt -v    # Show warnings and successes
python3 main.py -f domains.txt -vv   # Show errors too
python3 main.py -f domains.txt -vvv  # Full debug log
```
