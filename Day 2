* How to use the terminal with simple commands
* How files and directories are arranged

**Linux Permissions**
Files have three types of users:

* User (u) – The file owner
* Group (g) – Group of users
* Others (o) – Anyone else

Permissions:

* r – read (can view the file)
* w – write (can edit the file)
* x – execute (can run the file)

Example:
rw-r--r--
This means:

* Owner can read and write
* Group can only read
* Others can only read

Important commands:

* chmod – Change file permissions
* chown – Change file owner
